Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Documentation
Overview
This document outlines the process of building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using credit card data. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

Data Preprocessing
Data Loading
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. This dataset is expected to contain transaction details and a binary 'Class' column indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).

python
Download
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
(Here you would include a summary of the EDA process, insights gathered from the data, and any visualizations created.)

Handling Missing Values
(Describe the strategy used to handle missing values, if any were present in the dataset.)

Feature Scaling
The features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that the model is not biased by the scale of any feature.

python
Download
Copy code
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop('Class', axis=1))
Class Imbalance Handling
The class imbalance is addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic samples for the minority class.

python
Download
Copy code
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = smote.fit_resample(scaled_features, data['Class'])
Model Training and Selection
Data Splitting
The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.

python
Download
Copy code
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_res, y_res, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Model Selection
Two models are considered for this task: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. Logistic Regression is used initially due to its simplicity and interpretability.

python
Download
Copy code
log_reg = LogisticRegression()
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
(Random Forest code is commented out but can be used by uncommenting the relevant section.)

Model Evaluation
Making Predictions
The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set.

python
Download
Copy code
predictions = log_reg.predict(X_test)
Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.

python
Download
Copy code
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.show()
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
(Include a discussion of the results, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and their implications for fraud detection.)

Conclusion and Further Steps
The initial model shows promising results, but further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and experimenting with different models. The final model can be deployed to predict new transactions and flag potential frauds for further investigation.
